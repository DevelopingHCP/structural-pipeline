# dHCP Structural Pipeline v1.1

![pipeline image](structural_pipeline.png)

The dHCP structural pipeline is a software for the structural analysis of the neonatal brain MRI (T1 and T2) that consists of:<br>
* cortical and sub-cortical volume segmentation
* cortical surface extraction (white matter and pial surface)
* cortical surface inflation and 
* projection to sphere

## Publication
The pipeline is described in detail in:

A. Makropoulos and E. C. Robinson et al. "The Developing Human Connectome Project: a Minimal Processing Pipeline for Neonatal Cortical Surface Reconstruction (<a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/07/125526">link</a>)

## Dependencies
#### 1. FSL
The dHCP structural pipeline uses the <b>FSL</b> software. This can be installed by following the instructions:

<details>
<summary> <b>Ubuntu / Debian GNU</b></summary>

http://neuro.debian.net/install_pkg.html?p=fsl-complete
  
</details>

<details>

## Installation
The installation requires <b>FSL</b> and the <b>packages</b> specified in the <b>Dependencies</b> section.<br>
After installing these dependencies, the pipeline is installed by running:
* ./setup.sh -j [num_cores] 

where [num_cores] the number of CPU cores used to compile the pipeline software 
<br>

The setup script installs the following software packages.
   
| Software        | Version           
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| <a href="https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITK">ITK</a>      | 4.11.1 
| <a href="https://github.com/Kitware/VTK">VTK</a>      | 7.0.0     
| <a href="https://github.com/Washington-University/workbench">Connectome Workbench</a>  | 1.2.2  
| <a href="https://github.com/BioMedIA/MIRTK">MIRTK</a>  | dhcp-v1
| <a href="https://github.com/amakropoulos/SphericalMesh">SphericalMesh</a>  | dhcp-v1.1

The '-h' argument can be specified to provide more setup options:
* ./setup.sh -h

Once the installation is successfully completed, if desired, the different commands/tools built (workbench, MIRTK and pipeline commands) can be included in the shell PATH by running:
* . parameters/path.sh


## Run

The pipeline can be run with the following command:

./dhcp-pipeline.sh [subject_ID] [session_ID] [scan_age] -T2 [T2_image] \( -T1 [T1_image] \) \( -t [num_threads] \)

where:

| Argument        | Type      | Description     
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-------------:|
| subject_ID| string | Subject ID
| session_ID| string | Session ID
| scan_age| double |Subject post-menstrual age (PMA) in weeks (number between 28-44). <br>If the age is <28w or >44w, it will be set to 28w or 44w respectively.
| T2_image| nifti image | The T2 image of the subject
| T1_image| nifti image |The T1 image of the subject (Optional)
| num_threads| integer |Number of threads (CPU cores) used (default: 1) (Optional)

Examples:
* ./dhcp-pipeline.sh subject1 session1 44 -T2 subject1-T2.nii.gz -T1 subject1-T1.nii.gz -t 8
* ./dhcp-pipeline.sh subject2 session1 36 -T2 subject2-T2.nii.gz -T1 subject2-T1.nii.gz 
* ./dhcp-pipeline.sh subject3 session4 28 -T2 subject3-T2.nii.gz 

The output of the pipeline is the following directories:
* sourcedata   : folder containing the source images (T1,T2) of the processed subjects
* derivatives  : folder containing the output of the pipeline processing
